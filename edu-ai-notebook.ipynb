It was first played in small towns and eventually became a professional sport. The game is played with two teams, each consisting of nine players. The objective of the game is to score more runs than the opposing team by hitting a ball with a bat and running around a series of bases. Baseball has evolved over time, with changes in rules and equipment. Today, it is played at various levels, from little league to professional leagues like Major League Baseball (MLB).\",\n",

The game consists of four quarters, and each team has a chance to possess the ball and score. Players can pass, run, or kick the ball to gain yards and ultimately score touchdowns or field goals.
