      "Chess is a strategic board game that has been played for centuries. It is played on a square board divided into 64 squares of alternating colors. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means the king is in a position to be captured (in 'check') and there is no legal move to remove the threat (mate). Chess requires critical thinking, problem-solving, and planning ahead. It is often considered a game of strategy and tactics.\n",
