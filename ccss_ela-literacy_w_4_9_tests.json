Baseball is a game played with a bat and ball between two teams of nine players each. The objective of the game is to score more runs than the opposing team. The game is played on a field with four bases: first base, second base, third base, and home plate. The offensive team takes turns batting, while the defensive team tries to prevent them from scoring. The pitcher throws the ball towards the batter, who tries to hit it and advance to the bases. If the batter successfully hits the ball and reaches a base without being tagged out, they are safe. The defensive team can get the offensive players out by catching a fly ball, tagging them with the ball, or forcing them out at a base.
